# Compound data type
```.env
Until now we were reading about all the scalers data type (int, float, str).
Some of Compound data type
- list
- dict
- set
- tuple
```
#### **list**
```
How to declare
list1 = list()
list2 = []
list3 = [1,2,'Vivek', list2, None]
It is a mutable data type.
```
### **dict**
```
How to declare
dict1 = dict()
dict2 = {}
dict3 = {"1": 1, 2:"Two", "three": dict2}
dict is combination of key and value, where key mandatorly should be immutable.
```
### **set**
```
Set is combination of unique objects. It is a mutable data type.
set1 = {1,2,"vivek", None}
```
### **tuple**
```
Tuple is a immutable data type, which is very similar to list.
(1,2,3,"duu")
