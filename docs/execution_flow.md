#Execution Flow
```
In python code get executed sequentially. To break the execution flow we use conditions.
Ex-
number =12
if number//2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is an even number.")
elif number//2 != 0:
    print(f"{number} is an odd number.")
else:
    print("Invalid Entry")
```

#####Conditional Operators
```
Operators help us in controling the flow.
> - less than
< - greater than
>= - less than equal to
<= - greater than equal to
== - equal to
!= - not equal to

```
